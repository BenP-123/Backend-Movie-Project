This is an express server designed to handle requests for CRUD operations.

Project setup
Follow the instructions below to get this project up and running on your own machine:

Download the Qualified assessment files to your computer.
Run npm install to install the project.
Use Postman to test your application and visit this repository (https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-movie-front-end) to connect your backend work to a frontend application.
Run npm test to run the tests.
Note: Note that the tests make use of an in-memory SQLite database. When updating a record in an in-memory SQLite database, the server does not automatically respond with an array of updated records like PostgreSQL does. As a result, when updating a record, you will need to query the database again to return updated record.
